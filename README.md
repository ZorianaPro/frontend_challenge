# Frontend Challenge
Hey there, this is a challenge for a beginners in frontend to try what they can do and hopefully learn something new.

In this project you can do whatever you want, use any frontend framework if you know one, use any way to get data from the server and display it, connect backend if you want, but you don't hae to.

Basic requirements are:

1. Create web page.
2. Use HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript (ES6) at least menu hover. 
3. Make animations where you feel it is needed
4. Make sure that page is responsive and look good on most of phones and tablets (use common break points)
5. Use this data.json file from this project to display information about one product on the page. You can use ajax, fetch or whatever you are familiar with
6. Connect everything that it would be super easy to check the output.

Something you have to do to be able to do it:
1. Give me your email and I will add you to the project on zeplin
2. Create folder with your name in this project and work with this repo, than I will pe able also to give you some recommendations about git. NOTE: try no write meaningful commit messages, and work clean, let's pretend that it is a real project :)
3. Write documentation if it's necessary and add README if you want to address something
4. If you have server and what to deploy your page there and provide me a link - do it! But I wanna see souse code still.
5. Make an initial commit on the day of start, so I will se how much time it took you.
